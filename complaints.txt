Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to complain about a piece of glassware that I recently purchased from your store. Unfortunately, the glassware is defective and I would like a replacement.

The defect is that the glassware is chipped. It is clearly a manufacturing defect as it came out of the package this way. I would appreciate it if you could send me a new piece of glassware as soon as possible.

Thank you for your time



Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with a recent purchase I made from your online store. On January 24, 2019, I ordered a crystal wine decanter set, and on January 26, 2019, it arrived. Upon opening the package, I was horrified to see that the wine decanter was chipped!

I am extremely disappointed and angry, as I paid good money for this set, and it arrived in less than satisfactory condition. I would like you to replace the decanter as soon as possible, and I would appreciate it if you could expedite the shipping process.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to complain about a glass I bought from you last week. The glass was advertised as being perfectly clear, but when I received it, it was full of impurities and was very cloudy.

I am very disappointed, as this is not the quality I expect from your products. I would like you to replace the glass with one that is of the advertised quality.
